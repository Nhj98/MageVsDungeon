# MageVsDungeon
I'm fresh out of highschool and decided to take up programming as a hobby. This is my first attempt to learn programming and I decided to go with the laguage python due to it looking the most simplistic. After ruffly a week of learning the basics I decided to make an attempt at a text based adventure style game. This is what I have done in the few hours I have put in to it.
